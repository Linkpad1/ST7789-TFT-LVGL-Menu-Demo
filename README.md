Simple ST7789 [240x280] Touchscreen demonstration using Squareline Studios to design the UI on an ST412ZG Discovery board (Although could be easily ported to any STM32 MCU if memory allows)

There are 3 pages [home screen, page1, page2] which can be changed by using the pushbuttons.

The ST7789 SPI display itself was purchased from Ali Express it uses a CST816T Touch driver and an 18 way ribbon FPC connector.
